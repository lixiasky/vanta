Project Overview

Vanta is a lightweight, fast, command-line-based network behavior analyzer. It reconstructs protocol-level flows and extracts structured activity from captured data.

Unlike full-featured GUI tools like Wireshark, Vanta focuses on clarity, structure, and simplicity — ideal for custom scripting and minimal setups.

Why I Built This

This project is not just code — it's a response. Amid political pressure, some universities like Harvard, MIT, and CMU stood up for international students.

> I’m just an ordinary undergraduate with no resources or background. This is my way of responding — not by petition, but through code. Vanta may be small, but it’s real, and it’s mine.



I know Vanta is a "toy version" of Wireshark — I still use Wireshark myself in real scenarios.
